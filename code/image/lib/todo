identify train using dot with letter on it. "A" is the locomotive

display live feed of track
learn button:
    indicate the track number we will be learning
    automatic:
        start moving train record positions of train 
            until we have looped or until we manually press "stop"
    manual:
        using mouse

annotate:
    using mouse, indicate:
        - splitter: and say for which tracks in transfers to
        - crossings

save learned map on disk


loading:
    overlay learned tracks on image so that we can adjust camera to match
    automatically make corrections when train is running if we see we are offset



------------------


using pre-recorded video:
    detect track
        it needs to know where tracks are because that's how we'll know if an obect is close to the service track or the main track
    show track on screen
    detect train
        show on screen as a different color
    detect color dot.
        show on screen with rectangle around it

    draw line with distance in centimeters
        put a pre-measured square on floor to benchmark distance
        from train to dot
        track to dot


    use camera instead of pre-recorded video
    control train:
        tell it to go to dot
        tell it to go to an arbitrary place on screen
        close road crossing when near
        move from service track to main track using track shifter

        - QT video reader from wireless camera feed
            - use QVideoProbe to get frames and analyze. Show on screen

Detection solutions
    - pure image processing: detect tracks by detecting features. Could be hard because there is a lot of noise around tracks
        need to apply several algo on top of each other. but which ones?
            1- filter out everything that is not black
            2- Use canny edge detection

    - IR leds:
        put IR leds on each track segments
        put IR leds on point of interest (use different intensity to differentiate)
    - color detection
        put color dots on tracks and points of interest. The advantage is that we can color code things
